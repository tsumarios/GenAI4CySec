# (Gen)AI4CySec

A collection of spooky scripts that demonstrate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to support CySec tasks.

This repository originated from an initial set of scripts that I wrote while attending the ["Generative AI: Boost Your Cybersecurity Career"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-boost-your-cybersecurity-career) course by IBM.

## GenAI Scripts

This repository includes the following scripts:

- [ram_reserver.c](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/scripts/ram_reserver.c) - A C script designed to allocate a large portion of RAM to get the system under memory pressure (DoS).
- [cookie_manipulator.py](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/scripts/cookie_manipulator.py) - A Python script to demonstrate Anti-Forensics manipulation of HTTP cookies.
- [docx_terminator.py](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/scripts/docx_terminator.py) - A Python script that removes DOCX files.
- [keystroke_logger.py](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/scripts/keystroke_logger.py) - A basic Python keystroke logger to understand the mechanics of keylogging.
- [local_port_blocker.py](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/scripts/local_port_blocker.py) - A Python script to block specified local ports, calling iptables.
- [spyware.py](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/scripts/spyware.py) - A simple example of Python spyware to illustrate common techniques used in malicious software.
- [spyware_detector.sh](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/scripts/spyware_detector.sh) - A shell script to detect and remove spyware by scanning for known signatures and behaviours.

All the scripts were created with the help of ChatGPT as a demonstration of its support for cybersecurity tasks.

## AI4CySec Notebook

This repository also includes a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/notebooks/ai4cysec.ipynb) that provides a practical demonstration of how Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be applied for cybersecurity purposes. In particular, the notebook features an example to distinguish between *anti-forensics* techniques and *legitimate privacy* practices.

The notebook includes various classification algorithms such as *K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, XGBoost,* and *Neural Networks*.
Futhermore, it provides an introduction to **Adversarial Machine Learning** with an example based on Fast Gradient Sign Method.

As the icing on the cake, the notebook was created with the help of ChatGPT, too.

## LLM-Powered Applications

This repository also includes the following LLM-powered applications:

- [ach_llm_app.py](https://github.com/tsumarios/GenAI4CySec/blob/main/llm_apps/ach_llm_app.py) - A Python script that creates a Web application for conducting Threat Modelling brainstorming by means of an Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH).
